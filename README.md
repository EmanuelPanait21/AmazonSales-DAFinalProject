Amazon Sales Project:

The goal of this project is to identify the business problems and opportunities for improvement through data analysis, formulate a well-defined hypothesis,
research question or problem statement and apply appropriate data analysis techniques to answer the question.
The Amazon Sales dataset available on Kaggle is a collection of sales data for different products sold on Amazon from 2015 to 2021. 
The dataset includes information such as the product name,its category, the date and time of sale, the price of the product, the number of units sold, the shipping
country and the customer reviews and ratings.
This dataset can be used for a variety of analyses, including sales forecasting, product recommendations, and market trend analysis.
By examining the sales data, one can identify which products are most popular, which categories have the highest sales volume, and which counties have the most sales.
The dataset can also be used to identify patterns in customer behavior, such as when they tend to make purchases, which products they purchase together
and which products have the highest ratings and reviews. This information can be used to improve marketing strategies, customer engagement and product design.

Objectives

1.Understand Sales Performance  of a particular product or category over time.  It allows you to identify the best selling products, the least selling products
and the product categories that are performing well or poorly.

2.Identify Sales Trends such as seasonality, changes in consumer preferences and the impact of external factors like promotions and discounts.
This information can be used to make informed decisions about inventory management and pricing strategies.

3.Optimize Pricing  by providing insights into the pricing strategies, the impact of promotions and discounts on sales and the price elasticity of different products.

4.Improve Marketing Strategies by identifying the most effective channels for driving sales, the most effective messaging and promotional strategies and the customer segments that are 
most responsive to different marketing initiatives.

5.Forecast Future Sales by analyzing historical sales data and identifying patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions about future sales performance.
This information can be used to optimize inventory management, pricing strategies and marketing initiatives.

Questions

Possible insights related to customers behavior and marketing strategies

1.What are the top-selling categories on Amazon?

Based on the top-selling categories marketing efforts can be focused on promoting products in these categories.  Targeted advertising campaigns can be run on social

2.What is the average discount percentage offered on products?

Analyzing the average discount percentage offered on products can help to decide whether the  pricing strategy need to be adjusted. If the discount percentage is lower
than the industry average,it would be necessary to offer more competitive prices to attract customers.

3.Are products with higher ratings more likely to be purchased by customers?

reviews. Positive ratings and reviews can increase the credibility and reputation of  products, which can lead to more sales.


4.How many customers are more likely to purchase products with a higher discount percentage?
